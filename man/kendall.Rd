\title{Compute the Kendall distance matrix
Kendall's distance measures the depth of the most recent common infector (MRCI) for each pair of nodes with respect to the source (patient 0).}

}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A data frame representing a transmission tree, with the first column containing the infector IDs and the second the infectee IDs.}
}
\value{
A square, symmetric matrix of Kendall's distances between nodes.
