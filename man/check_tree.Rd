\title{Check the Validity of a Transmission Tree}
\usage{
check_tree(tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A data frame with two columns: \code{from} and \code{to}. The \code{from} column denotes the infector,
and the \code{to} column denotes the infectee.}
}
\value{
Returns nothing if the tree meets all criteria. If the input is invalid,
an error is thrown specifying the violated condition.
}
\description{
Validates whether a given transmission tree meets the following topology:
\itemize{
\item The graph is weakly connected (= a single introduction)
\item The graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with no cycles or self-loops.
\item Any node has at most one infector (no nodes have in-degree > 1).
}
}
\examples{
# A valid tree
valid_tree <- data.frame(from = c("A", "A", "B", "C"), to = c("B", "C", "D", "E"))
check_tree(valid_tree)

# Invalid tree: contains a cycle
invalid_tree_cycle <- data.frame(from = c("A", "B", "C"), to = c("B", "C", "A"))
\dontrun{
check_tree(invalid_tree_cycle)  # Error: must be a DAG
}

# Invalid tree: multiple introductions
invalid_tree_multiple_roots <- data.frame(from = c("A", "B"), to = c("C", "D"))
\dontrun{
check_tree(invalid_tree_multiple_roots)  # Error: Must have exactly one root node
}
